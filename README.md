# TextToImageSynthesisStackGAN
This is a StackGAN implementation for text to image synthesis. The stage 1 GAN architecture has been modified for better results.
Create the following folders in your google drive and change the paths in the code accordingly.
1. weights 
2. output_stage1 - Result of your stage 1 self attention GAN 
3. output_stage2 - Result of stage 2 GAN
